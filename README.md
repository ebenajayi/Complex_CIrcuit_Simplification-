This project simplifies complex electrical circuits by applying reduction rules

The following steps were taken in modelling of the system

• Identification: The first step in acquiring knowledge for an expert system is to characterize the important aspect of the problem. For this circuit, we are to apply reduction rules to a given circuit of resistors to obtain the equivalent resistance.

• Conceptualization: The circuit structure is defined using a frame-based system which allowed for incorporation of structural knowledge into the knowledge base. Rules are defined to search through the knowledge base to reduce the specified networks.

• Formalization: This process involves mapping the key concepts, sub problems, and information flow characteristics isolated during conceptualization into more formal representations based on various knowledge engineering tools or frameworks. The template for the network is created and reduction rules were formulated.

• Implementation: Implementation involves mapping the formalized knowledge from the previous stage into the representational framework associated with the tool chosen for the problem. The prototype knowledge base is implemented by using JESS—a rule-based inference engine.

• Testing: The testing stage involves evaluating the prototype system and the representation forms used to implement it. Another circuit was developed as directed graph to test the expert system.
